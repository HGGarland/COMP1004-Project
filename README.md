# COMP1004-Project

This repository represents my submission for the COMP1004 coursework. The three files attatched besides this make up a single-page web application. This takes the form of a interactive text-based game. In order to start, simply open the html file on your browser of choice. Game overs are common in this game, the intention is for players to keep replaying from the beginning until they find a route to the end.

Please note: a number guessing puzzle was intended to be implemented at a certain point in the game but I was unable to get it fully functioning by the deadline. The display and code for this still exists but is non-functional. Please interact with the text nodes as normal duirng this point in the game.
